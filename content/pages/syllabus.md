Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

This course introduces fundamental properties of the neutron. It covers reactions induced by neutrons, nuclear fission, slowing down of neutrons in infinite media, diffusion theory, the few-group approximation, point kinetics, and fission-product poisoning. It emphasizes the nuclear physics bases of reactor design and its relationship to reactor engineering problems.

### Textbook

Lewis, Elmer E. _Fundamentals of Nuclear Reactor Physics_. Burlington, MA: Academic Press, 2008. ISBN: 9780123706317.

### Additional Resources

Duderstadt, James J., and Louis J. Hamilton. _Nuclear Reactor Analysis_. 1st ed. New York, NY: Wiley, 1976. ISBN: 9780471223634.

Assignments
-----------

Eight problem sets will be assigned and graded during the semester. The seven highest marks will be averaged and will count towards 20% of the final grade. Homework should ideally be made individually. You may work and get help from classmates, but please do not copy of each other. Also, feel free to use prior year's material for additional help (e.g. MIT OpenCourseWare).

MIT Statement on Plagiarism
---------------------------

Plagiarism—use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement—is a serious offense. It is the policy of the Literature Faculty that students who plagiarize will receive an F in the subject, and that the instructor will forward the case to the Committee on Discipline. Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available at the [Writing and Communication Center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/) and the [MIT Web site on Plagiarism](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/).
